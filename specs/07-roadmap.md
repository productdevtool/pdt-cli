* **pdt upgrade**: The "Maintainer." This command will compare the user's repository against the main PDT template. It will then use an AI prompt to attempt an intelligent, non-destructive merge of core file updates, helping users keep their tooling current.
* **pdt log**: Will provide real-time log tailing from services like Convex and Vercel.
* **pdt analyze**: Will be a data-focused utility for querying the project's first-party analytics.
* **pdt kit <action> <kit_name>**: Will be a dedicated command for managing "Power-Up Kits"â€”pre-packaged configurations and prompts for specific frameworks or platforms.
